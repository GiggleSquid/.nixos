My personal [NixOS](https://nixos.org) config.

Feel free to use this repo as inspiration, but be aware
- I am still learning Nix
- This is speciffically built for me to use and is not a framework

I plan to eventually move into full automation with tools like
[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) and others.

I might also add docs if I can actually focus for more than 20 minutes.
