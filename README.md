My personal [NixOS](https://nixos.org) config.
Also handles my [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) cluster via [Fluxcd](https://fluxcd.io).

Feel free to use this repo as inspiration, but be aware
- I am still learning Nix
- This is speciffically built for me to use and is not a framework

I plan to eventually move into full automation with tools like
[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate),
[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/), and others.

I might also add docs if I can actually focus for more than 20 minutes.
